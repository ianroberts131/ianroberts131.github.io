title: Lessons On Ego

> “So why do you do what you do? That’s the question you need to answer. Stare at it until you can. Only then will you understand what matters and what doesn’t.” – Ryan Holiday

The quote above is from a book I recently read by Ryan Holiday called ‘Ego is the Enemy’. The central tenet of the book is that no matter where we are in our careers (aspiring for something, having achieved success, or enduring some failure), that ego needs to be kept at bay in order to prevent ourselves from undermining our own potential. I’ve never considered myself an egomaniac, and have always viewed humility as a characteristic to strive for and value in others. However, this book has provided an enormous level of context with which to understand my career choices to date, and how I’ve let my own ego get in the way of maximizing the positive impact I can have on the world. By reflecting on how ego has impacted my career (and life) so far, I believe that I’ll be able to move forward with the humility and perspective needed to be a lifelong learner, which is foundational to being successful in an ever-changing world.

#### Why I Stayed in Actuarial Consulting

>“…each one of us has a unique potential and purpose; that means we’re the only ones who can evaluate and set the terms of our lives. Far too often, we look at other people and make their approval the standard we feel compelled to meet, and as a result, squander our very potential and purpose.” – Ryan Holiday

If there’s a quote that better encapsulates why I chose actuarial consulting (and stuck with it for 8 years), I certainly haven’t found it. While I never consciously tried to please or impress others, I think subconsciously it fed my ego to be in a career that was respected, paid well and made me look and feel ‘smart’. The actuarial exam process provided fertile grounds to display my math skills, grow my career and continue to feel the comfort of others’ approval. Though I consistently felt deep down that this wasn’t what I wanted to do, I continued the actuarial exam grind – taking 9 intensive mathematical exams over a 5-year timeframe. With each exam pass came more accolades, more promotions, more “way to go’s”, more fuel for my ego. I think even the grind fed my ego, as it was a cheap way to display my work ethic. And after all that, I obtained what everyone in my career is striving to obtain – the FSA credential. With my credential, the ‘consultant’ label, and the comfort of being good at something, most people around me think I’ve got everything I need to just coast along.
In the past couple years, I’ve come to realize that everything I did conformed to a generic one size fits all view of ‘success’. However, success is completely subjective, and should be measured by fulfillment and happiness rather than societal approval. Once this realization came over me, I shook off the sunk cost fallacy and vowed to find what I truly wanted to do.

#### My Transition into Software Development

>“A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the next challenge. A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room for ego there.” – Ryan Holliday

When I sat down to think about the type of work I wanted to do, the following three items were top of mind:

1. Ability to use my analytical skills to solve complex problems
2. Something that fed my insatiable appetite to learn
3. A greater sense of societal contribution. I want to create things that add value.

Once I stumbled across software development, it seemed to tick all of the boxes of what I was looking for. I then took an MIT course online, and absolutely fell in love with what I was learning. I shortly thereafter signed up for Bloc’s intensive 18-month Software Engineer program, and have spent my mornings, evenings and weekends learning and getting better. And in this endeavor, my lessons learned about ego have helped and continue to help me move forward and grow both as a developer and as a person. It takes humility to go from something I’m good at to something totally new. To confess holes in my understanding to mentors in order to gain insight and push through difficult concepts. In other words, I’m learning both software development and a greater sense of humility.

Ryan Holiday uses the metaphor of sweeping the floor to explain how keeping ego at bay takes work. If you just sweep once, the dust will come back and you’re back at square one. With this in mind, I try to consistently have the right perspective as I work towards becoming a software developer. I’m simultaneously humbled and excited by how much there is to learn, because I know I now have the opportunity to be a lifelong student and to gain the skills and insights needed to get the most out of the time I’ve got left.
