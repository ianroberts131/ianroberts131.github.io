Hi! My name is Ian and I live in Orange County California. I went to college at UC Santa Barbara where I obtained degrees in Financial Mathematics/Statistics and Economics/Mathematics. Following college I embarked on a 6 year journey to obtain the actuarial credentials of FSA and EA, which I finalized in 2015. During that time I have worked as a pension actuarial consultant.

While I love the people I work with and life is generally pretty great, I came to the realization that I don't love what I do for a living. That's why I enrolled in Bloc's 18 month Software Engineering track in March of 2016 and am spending my mornings, nights, and weekends preparing to become a developer. I've had a blast so far during the Rails and front-end web development courses, and I am excited to apply my growing skill set full time in the future.

When I'm not working or coding, I like to read (almost certainly non-fiction), listen to podcasts, play guitar, and spend time with my wife and my dog Norris.
